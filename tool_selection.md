# MAZEBOT // POSTMASTER - Tool and API Selection

This document details the selected tools and APIs for each functional module of the MAZEBOT // POSTMASTER system, based on the provided requirements and research into available technologies. The primary goal is to leverage a combination of powerful AI models, robust automation platforms, and specialized social media and email marketing tools to create a comprehensive and autonomous content management and engagement system.

## 1. Content Brain (Creation & Repurposing Engine)

**Objective**: To generate and repurpose multimedia content (captions, reels, posts, threads, memes) from existing material and prompts.

**Selected Tools/APIs**:

*   **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro API**: Chosen for its advanced multimodal capabilities, allowing it to understand and process various input formats (text, images, video, audio) which is crucial for repurposing content like past magazine PDFs and videos into new formats (reels, memes). Its long context window is also highly beneficial for analyzing extensive past magazine content for summarization and content remixing. Gemini 1.5 Pro's strong performance in creative insights and content generation aligns well with the module's output requirements.
*   **OpenAI GPT-4.5 API**: Selected to complement Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly for its strong natural language generation capabilities. GPT-4.5 excels in producing fluent and coherent text, making it ideal for crafting engaging captions, tweet threads, and AI-generated posts from editorial text. The combination of Gemini's multimodal understanding and GPT-4.5's text generation prowess will ensure high-quality and diverse content outputs.

## 2. Postmaster Scheduler (Auto Publishing Engine)

**Objective**: To schedule and publish content across various social media platforms, optimize posting times, and manage content reposting and engagement alerts.

**Selected Tools/APIs**:

*   **Make.com (formerly Integromat)**: This will serve as the central automation platform for the Postmaster Scheduler. Make.com's visual workflow builder, extensive app integrations, and advanced data manipulation capabilities make it highly suitable for orchestrating complex automation flows. It will be used to connect the Content Brain's outputs with social media scheduling tools, manage posting logic, and trigger WhatsApp alerts based on engagement spikes. The user's explicit preference for Make.com is also a key factor.
*   **Publer**: Chosen as the primary social media scheduling and management tool. Publer supports a wide array of social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Threads, X, Facebook, etc.), allowing for cross-platform publishing. Its features for customizing posts per channel, content management, and scheduling align directly with the requirements. Publer's ability to handle scheduled posts and potentially provide hooks for engagement data makes it a strong fit.
*   **Google Calendar API (via Make.com)**: For integrating Google Calendar for oversight and task management, as per the user's existing preference (grimson.darkhand@gmail.com). Make.com has robust integration with Google Calendar, enabling the scheduling and tracking of content publication events.

## 3. MailMaze (Email Composer & Blaster)

**Objective**: To compose and send weekly digest-style emails, manage email lists, and track email performance.

**Selected Tools/APIs**:

*   **Mailchimp**: A leading email marketing platform that offers comprehensive features for creating and sending email campaigns, managing subscriber lists, and tracking performance metrics (opens, clicks, forwards). Mailchimp's user-friendly interface and robust API make it an excellent choice for sending weekly digests and ensuring brand tone consistency. Make.com can seamlessly integrate with Mailchimp to automate the content pulling and campaign queuing process.
*   **Make.com (for automation)**: Will be used to automate the process of pulling content from the content queue (likely managed within the Asset Manager or a shared Google Sheet) and feeding it into Mailchimp for email composition and scheduling.

## 4. CommentRadar (Engagement Redirector)

**Objective**: To monitor social media comments and messages, identify high-priority interactions, and redirect them to WhatsApp, while also providing auto-responses.

**Selected Tools/APIs**:

*   **Make.com (for automation and API orchestration)**: Make.com will be the core orchestrator for CommentRadar. It will connect to various social media APIs, process incoming comments and messages, apply filtering logic (for high-priority, sales DMs, trolls/spam), and trigger actions like sending WhatsApp messages or auto-responses. Its ability to handle webhooks and conditional logic is essential here.
*   **Meta API (via Make.com)**: For monitoring and interacting with Facebook and Instagram DMs and comments. Make.com provides connectors for Meta's APIs, enabling the system to pull relevant data.
*   **X / Threads API (via Make.com)**: For monitoring and interacting with messages and comments on X (formerly Twitter) and Threads. Make.com's flexibility will allow integration with these platforms' APIs.
*   **Twilio (for WhatsApp Business API)**: Twilio is a reliable and widely used platform for programmatic communication, including the WhatsApp Business API. It will be used to send high-priority messages and summaries to the user's WhatsApp, as well as to facilitate auto-responses. Twilio's robust API and webhook support integrate well with Make.com.

## 5. Asset Manager

**Objective**: To store, organize, and manage all brand assets (visuals, audio, past content) and make them accessible for content generation and repurposing.

**Selected Tools/APIs**:

*   **Google Drive**: Aligns with the user's existing preference for Google services and provides a centralized, cloud-based storage solution for all multimedia assets. Google Drive's robust file management, sharing, and API capabilities make it ideal for this module. Make.com has excellent integration with Google Drive, allowing the Content Brain to fetch relevant images and the Postmaster Scheduler to access media for posts.
*   **Make.com (for automation)**: Will facilitate the automated fetching and organization of assets within Google Drive, and potentially trigger processes for remixing visuals.

## 6. Analytics Brain

**Objective**: To pull weekly performance reports, identify top-performing content, and suggest strategies for boosting or reposting.

**Selected Tools/APIs**:

*   **Publer (Analytics)**: Publer, as the chosen social media management tool, provides built-in analytics that can be leveraged to pull data on post performance, engagement, and follower growth across connected platforms. This will be the primary source for social media specific metrics.
*   **Mailchimp (Analytics)**: Mailchimp offers detailed reports on email campaign performance, including open rates, click-through rates, and subscriber engagement. This data will be crucial for the MailMaze module's analytics.
*   **Google Sheets (via Make.com)**: For consolidating data from various sources (Publer, Mailchimp, potentially direct API calls via Make.com) into a structured format for analysis and reporting. Google Sheets provides flexibility for creating custom reports and visualizations, and aligns with the user's Google ecosystem preference. Make.com can automate the process of extracting data and populating Google Sheets.
*   **Make.com (for data aggregation and automation)**: Will be used to pull data from Publer and Mailchimp (and potentially other sources), aggregate it, and push it into Google Sheets for further analysis. It can also be configured to trigger alerts or generate summary reports based on predefined metrics.
