## 4. Data Flow and Module Interactions

### 4.1. Content Brain (Creation & Repurposing Engine)

*   **Inputs**: Past magazine content (PDFs, articles, posts) from Google Drive (Asset Manager), user-defined prompts/themes, current weekâ€™s promotion goals.
*   **Process**: Make.com orchestrates calls to Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and OpenAI GPT-4.5 APIs. Gemini 1.5 Pro analyzes and summarizes long-form content (PDFs, articles) and extracts key information. GPT-4.5 generates various content formats (captions, tweet threads, carousel text, AI-generated posts) based on the extracted information and user prompts. For visual content repurposing (reels, memes), Gemini 1.5 Pro's multimodal capabilities are leveraged to understand existing video/image assets and guide the generation of new visual content.
*   **Outputs**: Generated captions, repurposed reels, AI-generated posts, carousel post text, tweet threads, meme formats. These outputs are then pushed to the Content Queue/Asset Manager.

### 4.2. Asset Manager

*   **Inputs**: Newly generated content from the Content Brain, existing brand assets (visuals, audio) from Google Drive.
*   **Process**: This module primarily interacts with Google Drive via Make.com. It stores and organizes all content and assets. It also serves as a central repository for the 


Content Brain and other modules to retrieve necessary assets.
*   **Outputs**: Organized and accessible content and assets for other modules.

### 4.3. Postmaster Scheduler (Auto Publishing Engine)

*   **Inputs**: Content from the Content Queue/Asset Manager.
*   **Process**: Make.com pulls content from the Asset Manager. It then uses Publer API to schedule posts across various social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Threads, X, Facebook, Medium). The scheduling logic within Make.com determines the best posting times per platform, based on predefined rules or insights from the Analytics Brain. It also manages automatic reposting of high-performing content after a specified period (e.g., 2-3 weeks). Google Calendar API is used to log scheduled posts for user oversight. Make.com also monitors engagement metrics (via Publer or direct social media APIs) and sends WhatsApp alerts via Twilio if engagement spikes, as defined by the CommentRadar module.
*   **Outputs**: Scheduled social media posts, updated Google Calendar entries, WhatsApp alerts for engagement spikes.

### 4.4. MailMaze (Email Composer & Blaster)

*   **Inputs**: Curated content from the Content Queue/Asset Manager (e.g., weekly digest content).
*   **Process**: Make.com retrieves relevant content for the weekly digest from the Asset Manager. It then interacts with the Mailchimp API to compose and send weekly digest-style emails to the user's email list. The system ensures the tone and voice match the ART MAZE brand. Mailchimp handles the actual email blasting and provides tracking for opens, clicks, and forwards. Make.com can also be configured to send previews of upcoming issues or community features.
*   **Outputs**: Sent weekly digest emails, email campaign performance data (tracked by Mailchimp).

### 4.5. CommentRadar (Engagement Redirector)

*   **Inputs**: Real-time comments and messages from various social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, X, Threads).
*   **Process**: Make.com continuously monitors incoming comments and messages via Meta API, X/Threads API, and potentially other social media APIs. It applies filtering logic to identify high-priority messages (e.g., sales inquiries, urgent questions) and flags trolls/spam. High-priority messages are immediately redirected to the user's WhatsApp via Twilio (using the WhatsApp Business API) as webhooks. For frequently asked questions, Make.com triggers auto-responses using predefined saved replies. This module is critical for ensuring timely and effective engagement with the audience.
*   **Outputs**: Redirected high-priority messages to WhatsApp, auto-responses to FAQs, flagged trolls/spam for review.

### 4.6. Analytics Brain

*   **Inputs**: Performance data from Publer (social media analytics), Mailchimp (email campaign analytics), and potentially other sources.
*   **Process**: Make.com pulls weekly reports from Publer (top-performing content, follower growth, engagement spikes) and Mailchimp (opens, clicks, forwards). This data is then aggregated and pushed into Google Sheets for comprehensive analysis. The Analytics Brain, through Make.com, can be configured to generate insights and suggest actions, such as which content to boost or repost, based on predefined metrics and thresholds. This module provides the feedback loop necessary for continuous optimization of content strategy.
*   **Outputs**: Weekly performance reports in Google Sheets, insights and suggestions for content optimization.
